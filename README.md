# cv_html_only

I always loved the layouts and design of websites from the 90s, before all the fancy CSS and Javascript. 
Yes, sometimes it is a bit cringy. 
I built this page using only HTML. Any little bit of style utilizes the built in attributes (most of them deprecated since the introduction of CSS) 
This page functions mainly as my CV and less as a portfolio site, but I will continue to update the content periodically.
